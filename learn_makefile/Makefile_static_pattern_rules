# STATIC PATTERN RULES
# static pattern rules are another way to write less in a Makefile

# syntax:
#targets...: target-pattern: prereq-pattern ...
#	commands

#charGPT syntax:
#%.target_extension: %.source_extension
#    <recipe>

# The given target is matched by the target-pattern (via % wildacard).
# Whatever was matched is called STEM.
# The STEM is then substituded into the prereq-pattern,  to generate the target's prereqs.

objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
all: $(objects)

# These files compile via implicit rules
foo.o: foo.c 
bar.o: bar.c
all.o: all.c

all.c:
	echo "int main() {return 0;}" > all.c 
%.c:
	touch $@
clean:
	rm -f *.c *.o all
